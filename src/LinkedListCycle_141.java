    i hate linked listssss

    given the head of LL determines i there is  acycle in the list wt is cycle
    a cycle is when there is a node in the list that can be reach again if you keep going
    so like if you have a node that has two separate nodes pointing to it instead of hte usual one that is behind ti
    pos is index of node
    the next pointer is connected ?
    pos is the index of the node that the next variable is pointing to
    sp if you hit next then you get the pointer to the next variable in the linked list
    so im on pos and pos.next is the nest one in the linked list
    boolean return

    okay tail is always last node so the next fo rtale should be null
head is pointing at the first one so maybe make fummy head wiht -1 node again

pos is telling you whcih node the tail is pointing at ohhhhh
so if pos is null then no cycle okay so confusing for no reason
